/// \section hpp_wholebody_step_corba_intro Introduction
///
/// This package implements a Corba server running hpp-wholebody-step
/// package functions and the corresponding client.
///
/// The corba server part is compiled into library
/// \c libhpp-wholebody-step-corba.so that implements the following
/// class:
///   \li hpp::wholebodyStep::Server.
/// The corba services provided by the library are described in interface
///   \li hpp::corbaserver::wholebody_step::Problem.
///
/// The client part is provided through python module
/// \c hpp.corbaserver.wholebody_step
///
/// An executable called \c hpp-wholebody-step-server is installed.
/// This executable runs
///   \li the corba server implemented by library
///       \c libhpp-wholebody-step-corba.so, as well as
///   \li the corba server implemented in \htmlonly<a class="el" href="@HPP_CORBASERVER_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">hpp-corbaserver</a>\endhtmlonly.
///
/// See these package documentations for details.
///
/// \section hpp_wholebody_step_corba_howto_communicate \
/// How to communicate with the CORBA server
///
/// The easiest way is
///
///     to launch \c hpp-wholebody-step-server executable,
///     open a python terminal and type:
///     \code
///     from hpp.corbaserver.wholebody_step.client import Client as WholebodyStepClient
///     wcl = WholebodyStepClient ()
///     \endcode
/// Then variable wcl contains a member \c problem that can send
/// requests to the server. For instance
///
///     \code
///     wcl.problem.addStaticStabilityConstraints (q0)
///     \endcode
///
/// \section how_to_embed How to embed a server in an application
///
/// Embedding the corba server into an application can be done by linking the
/// application with \c libhpp-wholebody-step-corba.so in a similar way as
/// hpp-corbaserver corba server. See documentation of classes
/// hpp::corbaServer::Server and hpp::wholebodyStep::Server for details.
